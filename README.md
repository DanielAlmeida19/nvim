# NeoVim dotfiles

this repository is a simple and NON-MINIMALISTIC setup for neovim using mainly snacks and plugins for navigation, transformations and coding!

Of course, these dotfiles are made thinking in a widescreen monitor (21:9), which is my case

I coding mainly in:
 - Java
 - Python
 - C
 - Flutter (very recently)

then, its common that I use plugins and configurations thinking in this.

## Main Plugins
 - snacks.nvim (explorer, finds with `picker`, gh integration)
 - nvim-autopairs (completations for pairs)
 - nvim-ufo (cold folding)
 - noice.nvim (better UI for inputs and docs)
 - toggleterm.nvim (easy terminal toggle and split)
 - trouble.nvim (better view and searchs of diagnostics)
 - nvim-lualine (better status bar - but fast!)
 - gitsigns.nvim (a git diff integration with neovim)
 - tiny-inline-diagnostics.nvim (better diagnostics in virtual text)
 - Comment.nvim  (inteligent and fast plugin of comments)
 - telescope.nvim (find functions)
 - Lazy.nvim (plugin manager)
 - mason.nvim (lsp, linter, DAP and formatter manager)
 - bufferline.nvim (A buff viewer like modern code editors)

## Lsps and specific languages plugins and configs
 - flutter-tools.nvim (Integration with dartls, flutter and neovim)
 - Pyright (A Python LSP and Type Checker, added with the interface `vim.lsp.config()`)
 - nvim-jdtls (A plugin to use jdtls as an LSP for Java Language)
 - clang (A C LSP, added with the interface `vim.lsp.config()`)

## Appearence
 - catppuccin/nvim (theme color - with macchiato palette)

## Notice
I will try maintain this repository up to date, but is noteworthy that is not made to be replicable;
